    "Based on the results of the data understanding phase, several implications for data preparation and modeling were identified. Multiple numerical attributes, such as tuition-related and expenditure-related variables, exhibit skewed distributions and large value ranges, indicating that scaling or transformation may be required to ensure stable model behavior. Additionally, several attributes related to admissions and test scores contain missing values, which motivates the use of appropriate imputation strategies during data preparation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation analysis revealed that some institutional attributes are highly correlated, particularly among admission and selectivity-related variables. This suggests that feature selection or dimensionality reduction may be necessary to reduce redundancy and prevent multicollinearity in subsequent modeling steps. Furthermore, the presence of mixed data types (numerical and categorical) indicates that encoding strategies must be applied consistently before model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these findings highlight the need for a structured and reproducible preprocessing pipeline and motivate the selection of modeling approaches that are robust to correlated features, varying scales, and incomplete data.\n"
